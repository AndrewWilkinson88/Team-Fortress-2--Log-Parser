Two things about the coding with this project that I had I never dealt with before, Python and Regular Expressions. I was very interested in learning both of these things at the time. My friend is a python guru and made the language sound like a good tool to have under one's belt. RegEx seemed easy enough, but I only found out after I finished my project I wasn't using them correctly and could've made string parsing a lot easier. By using "submatches" I could've saved matched strings to variables and than had access to those... Where as I did everything the hard way and used string functions like split to break down the log lines. Lesson learned however and will make a better implementation next time I go to make a string parser of some kind.
